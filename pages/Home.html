    <h2>Akira Toriyama</h2>
    <p>
        A legendary manga artist and character designer, born on April 5, 1955 in Kiyosu, Aichi, Japan
         Akira Toriyama, left us on March 1, 2024 at the age of 68. Due to a subdural hematoma. Perhaps you seen 
          some of his work, Dragonball, Dr. Slump, Dragon Quest or even Chrono Trigger, one cannot deny the outreached and the impact 
           of his work has done for millions of people and many generations to come. I think it is great for us all to come together, 
            and appreciate everything he have done and celebrate the life of Akira Toriyama. A beloved artist, father, husband, and human 
             being, we truly loss an amazing person. Thank you Akira Toriyama!!!!
